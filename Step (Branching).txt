if file is added in git (staged) then it can be unstaged by commmand:
"git restore --staged <file name>"  (file name is case sensitive)
Another way to do it: git restore <file name>
"git diff" diff of what changed but not staged
"git diff --staged" diff of what is staged but not yet committed
git commit -m “[descriptive message]” commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot
How to exit a git merge asking for commit message? (git/MERGE_MSG[+] [unix]) "press ESC and Shift+ zz". This command will save file and exit.
